h1. Upgrade from Bookyt 1.5 to 2.0

Bookyt 2.0 uses a different database system and supports multi tenancy. This
makes some manual steps necessary. Follow these instruction to enjoy all the
new features of Bookyt 2.0.

If you do not yet run the latest Bookyt 1.x release, please first upgrade to
release 1.5. It is available on github in the stable-1-5 branch.

h2. Backup Data

<pre>
bundle exec rails runner 'Backup.dump("upgrade-to-2.0.zip")'
</pre>

h2. Create PostgreSQL database

This is how it's done on Debian/Ubuntu. Please submit a patch if you've
figured out the steps on another system.

<pre>
sudo apt-get install postgresql
</pre>

<pre>
sed 's/\*mysql/*postgres/' -i 'config/database.yml'
</pre>

Lookup current username, password and database from config/database.yml
and use them in the following commands.

<pre>
sudo -u postgres -i
createuser $USER_NAME --no-createdb --no-createrole --no-superuser --pwprompt
createdb --owner $USER_NAME $DATABASE_NAME
</pre>

On a development system, you probably also want to do the steps for both
the development and test databases.

h2. Restore Data

Now import the data again.

<pre>
bundle exec rails runner 'Backup.restore "upgrade-to-2.0.zip"'
</pre>
