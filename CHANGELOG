1.2.0
=====
This release brings functions for salary management. With this module
you can create salary reports and payslips by entering just a little
bit of information. It's currently tailored to swiss law, but the
framework will handle other requirements with ease.

Localization for english has been improved and there's now a working
language switcher.

Invoices can now contain summary line items and calculations for relative
amounts are done in realtime while entering data.

Too many bugs fixed to mention:-)


1.1.0
=====
We did a major restyling of bookyt. It now looks less cluttered and
more to the point. The most frequently used functions are now
reachable withing 2 clicks. Freetext search for invoices and contacts
is available directly in the titlebar.

Much more control on bookings is provided by the new invoice
form interface. VESR setup and configuration has a new UI. Lots
of work has been put into pixel-perfect invoice printing.

Have fun with out best release up to now!
